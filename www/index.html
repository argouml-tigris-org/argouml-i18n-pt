 <title>ArgoUML in Portuguese</title>
</head>
<body>

The purpose of this project is to translate ArgoUML to Portuguese.
Another purpose is that it is in this project that the mailing list
for discussing how to use ArgoUML in Portuguese is located.<p>

For this project we have chosen the Portugese from Portugal.
If you'd prefer Portuguese from Brazil, you will have to discuss with
Linus Tolke for setting up another project for that.
You can changes this if you Sergio, if you prefer to work with
Portuguese from Brazil!<p>

What will be translated within this project is in order of priority:<ol>
<li>This page, the first web page.
<li>ArgoUML, the application.
<li>...
</ol>

In English for any non-Portuguese that may stumble over this page:
The purpose of this project is
to create a complete localization of ArgoUML in Portuguese and
to be the center for the ArgoUML community in Portuguese.
